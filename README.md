# FiBear Network Corp. Mobile App

## Overview

This mobile application, developed using React Native and Expo, provides a user-friendly interface for managing FiBear Network Corp. services.  It leverages Firebase for user authentication, and potentially, future features such as user data management and service interactions. This app provides features like a splash screen, sign-up, login, and a home screen.

## Features

*   **Splash Screen:** An initial splash screen to improve the user experience.
*   **User Authentication:**
    *   Sign-up functionality with email, password, and a terms and conditions agreement.
    *   Login functionality using email and password with a "Remember Me" option.
    *   Google Sign-In (with basic integration).
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Get Started Screen with options for Sign Up and Login.
    *   Sign Up Screen with form fields for name, email, password, and confirm password.
    *   Login Screen for email and password-based authentication.
    *   Home Screen to display user information and other relevant content (with a skeleton loader for a smooth experience).
    *   Modals for displaying messages, like successful sign-ups and log-ins.
    *   Animated transitions and UI elements for improved user engagement.
    *   A drawer-style menu for navigation.
*   **Navigation:**
    *   Uses React Navigation for screen management.
*   **Data Persistence:** Uses `AsyncStorage` to store user login credentials (email, password, and a rememberMe flag).
*   **Firebase Integration:**
    *   Firebase Authentication for user management, including sign-up, login, and Google Sign-In.
    *   Firebase Config for project setup.
*   **Animations and Visual Enhancements:**
    *   Uses `react-native-animatable` for animations.
    *   Gradients used with `expo-linear-gradient`.

## Technologies Used

*   **React Native:** A JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications.
*   **Expo:** A framework built on top of React Native, simplifying development with pre-built components and tools.
*   **Firebase:** A comprehensive platform for backend services:
    *   **Firebase Authentication:** User authentication (email/password, Google).
*   **React Navigation:** For screen navigation and management.
*   **React Native Paper:** for UI elements like `TextInput`, `Checkbox`.
*   **Expo-Linear-Gradient:** for creating gradient backgrounds.
*   **Expo Auth Session:**  For Google Sign-In (although the integration here is basic).
*   **React Native Animatable:** for animations and effects.
*   **AsyncStorage:** For storing user credentials.
*   **Expo-Font** for custom fonts.
*   **React Native Vector Icons** for icons.

## Prerequisites

*   **Node.js and npm/yarn:** Make sure you have Node.js and either npm or yarn installed on your development machine.
*   **Expo CLI:** Install the Expo command-line interface globally: `npm install -g expo-cli`
*   **Firebase Account:**  Create a Firebase account ([https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/)).
*   **Firebase Project:** Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console.
*   **Google Cloud Project and OAuth Consent Screen:**  You need a Google Cloud project and configured OAuth consent screen to use Google Sign-In.
*   **Mobile Device/Emulator:**  An Android or iOS device or an emulator/simulator for testing.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>  # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL
    cd <project-directory>  # Replace <project-directory> with the project directory
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Firebase Configuration:**

    *   Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console ([https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)).
    *   Add a web app to your Firebase project. You'll get the `firebaseConfig` object.
    *   Enable "Google" as a sign-in method in the Firebase console's Authentication section.
    *   **Important Google Cloud Configuration:** Configure your OAuth consent screen in the Google Cloud Console ([https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)). Set your app name, user support email, authorized domains (the domain of your Firebase project - often `firebaseapp.com`), and any required scopes (profile, email, etc.).
    *   **Android Setup (Required for Android):** If you're building for Android, add your app's SHA-1 and SHA-256 fingerprints to your Firebase project's settings. You generate these fingerprints using `keytool` (see Firebase docs for detailed instructions).
    *   **iOS Setup (Optional for iOS):**  If building for iOS, register your app's bundle identifier in the Firebase project and configure the appropriate iOS client ID.
    *   Create a `firebaseConfig.js` file (or similar) in your project and add your Firebase configuration:

   ```javascript
    // firebaseConfig.js
    export const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
      projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
      messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
    };
    ```

    *   **Important**: This is a *crucial* step. Make sure your `firebaseConfig.js` contains your *actual* Firebase configuration data.

4.  **Run the app:**

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

    This will start the Expo development server. You can then scan the QR code with your Expo Go app on your mobile device or use an emulator/simulator.

## Code Overview

*   **`App.js`:**  Sets up the app's navigation structure using `react-navigation/native`, defining the screens and their routes. Starts with the Splash Screen.
*   **`screens/SplashScreen2.js`:**  Displays the initial splash screen with a logo and a "Get Started" button. It uses animations.
*   **`screens/GetStartedScreen.js`:**  Provides the entry point for users. Offers options for Sign Up, Login, and Google Sign-In. Handles initial Google Sign-In functionality.
*   **`screens/SignUpScreen.js`:**  Handles the user registration process.  Includes form validation and Firebase authentication integration.  Uses `AsyncStorage` for the `rememberMe` checkbox.
*   **`screens/HomeScreen.js`:**  Displays the main content after successful login. Shows user information. Includes a skeleton loader for a better user experience while data loads.
*   **`config/firebaseConfig.js`:** Contains the Firebase configuration details.  This file *must* be present and correctly configured for the app to connect to Firebase.

## Key Functionality and How to Use

*   **Navigation:**  The app uses `react-navigation` to manage navigation between screens.
*   **Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in using email and password. The "Remember Me" functionality in the login screen stores credentials using `AsyncStorage`. Google sign-in is partially implemented.
*   **Firebase Integration:** Firebase Authentication is used for user registration, login, and Google Sign-In. The app connects to your specified Firebase project.
*   **Splash Screen:** The app starts with a splash screen for a better user experience.
*   **Home Screen:** Presents a basic home screen after login with a skeleton loader.

## Important Considerations and Next Steps

*   **Google Sign-In Implementation:** The Google Sign-In integration in `GetStartedScreen.js` and `SignUpScreen.js` is partially complete.  You *must* implement the Expo Auth Session's `useAuthRequest` hook and the related logic to handle the authentication flow correctly.  Make sure you have your Google Cloud credentials properly set up.
*   **Error Handling:** The app includes basic error handling. Implement more comprehensive error handling to provide a more robust user experience and handle authentication failures, storage errors, and network issues.  Display user-friendly error messages.
*   **Data Validation:** Implement stronger input validation in the `SignUpScreen.js` to validate email formats, password complexity, and other relevant fields.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:** Improve the UI and UX of the app through additional styling, animations, and user interface elements. Refine the design for a better overall experience.
*   **Firebase Data Storage:** Consider adding Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore to store user-related data, application settings, or other information.
*   **Further Navigation:** Implement the functionality for the drawer menu in the `HomeScreen`.
*   **Security:** Review your code for potential security vulnerabilities and follow best practices for mobile development.
*   **Testing:** Implement unit tests and user interface tests to ensure the app functions correctly.
